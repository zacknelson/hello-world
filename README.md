# hello-world

My name is Zack Nelson and I am the managing partner of a small web design and devleopment firm. I'm a finance and economics major and enjoy the intersection between business and technology. Avid technologist, I believe in the potential for technology to propel humanity to unexplored heights. This doesn't come without ethical responsibilities and we must remain vigilant in our responsibility as business leaders to ensure that the polarising forces of globalisation and technology does not cause immense societal rifts. 

I also love moon tacos. 

That is all.
